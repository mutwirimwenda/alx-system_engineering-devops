# Shell Basics

A collection of bash scripts that perform basic shell commands.

0. [Where am I?](./0-current_working_directory) - Print the absolute path name
   of the current working directory.
1. [What’s in there?](./1-listit) - Display the contents list of current
   directory.
2. [There is no place like home](./2-bring_me_home) - Change the working
   directory to user’s home directory without using any shell variables.
